# Who hasnâ€™t been tortured by the course selection system when they were in school?
My original intention of completing this program was to see how complicated the course selection system is. After some operation and experience, I found that it is indeed complicated. I no longer blame the course selection system.

# This is a simple project about course selection, designed to assist students in selecting courses for the fall semester. It allows users to input their preferences for courses and instructors, and then displays a list of selected courses based on those preferences.

# Guidence for using this progtam:

To run the program, execute course_selection.py. Ensure that this file is in the same directory as user_input.py.
As for inputting Preferences, when the program runs, it will guide you through the following steps:
1. Selecting the Semester: You will be asked to enter the semester. Currently, only the fall semester is available.
2. Selecting Courses: Enter the names of courses you are interested in, separated by commas. If a course is not found, you will be notified. You can press enter without typing anything to exit this step.
3. Selecting Instructors: Optionally, enter the names of preferred instructors, separated by commas.

# This program is rough and crude.
